See [Common Issues](common-issues) and how to fix them easily. Also contains general information on how to keep plugin maintained and how to avoid issues in the future.

A very common issue with other chat-related plugins is that they override our features or cause duplicate messages, or no messages at all. Using Towny/EssentialsChat/etc. or even BanManager or others? See [Listener Priorities](listener-priorities) on how to fix issues.
