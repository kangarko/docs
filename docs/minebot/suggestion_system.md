# MineBot Suggestion System Guide

## Overview

The Suggestion System enables server members to submit ideas, feedback, and feature requests directly through Discord. Each suggestion can be reviewed, approved, or rejected by staff members. The system includes reward capabilities for approved suggestions and utilizes Discord's interactive components for a seamless user experience.

## Key Features

- **Easy Submission Process**: Users submit suggestions via a Discord slash command and modal form
- **Staff Review Flow**: Moderators can approve or reject suggestions with feedback
- **Reward Integration**: Optionally reward users for approved suggestions (Discord roles and Minecraft items)
- **Notification System**: Automatic notifications for submission and review status
- **Multi-language Support**: Fully translatable interface for international communities
- **Database Storage**: Suggestions are stored and tracked in the database
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of all suggestion activity

## Configuration Guide

```json

## Advanced Features

### Reward Integration

The suggestion system can automatically reward users whose suggestions are approved:

```json
"reward": {
  "mode": "BOTH",
  "role": [1371228108598018089],
  "item": {
    "test1": ["give {minecraft_username} diamond 1"],
    "default": ["give {minecraft_username} apple 1"]
  }
}
```

- `mode`: Set to `"ROLE"` for Discord roles only, `"ITEM"` for Minecraft items only, or `"BOTH"` for both
- `role`: Array of Discord role IDs to assign

- `{discord_user_mention}` - Mentions the suggestion author
- `{discord_staff_username}` - Username of reviewing staff member
- `{discord_staff_user_id}` - ID of reviewing staff member
- `{discord_staff_user_mention}` - Mentions the staff member reviewing
- `{suggestion}` - The submitted suggestion text
- `{reason}` - The staff response/reason text
- `{minecraft_username}` - For users with linked accounts
- `{minecraft_uuid}` - For users with linked accounts
