# Boss™

Boss is a premium quality Spigot plugin that adds the possibility of creating custom monsters, animals and NPCs on your server. The custom monsters are called Bosses, and it is up to you how they behave or how they spawn. 

## What are Bosses
Bosses are simply vanilla Minecraft monsters and animals with enhanced behavior and features. You can create an Ultimate Zombie Warrior, or a special pig for your in-game events! Almost any animal and monster is supported, even mobs like Snowman, Iron Golem and Bats!

## What Can Be Boss Used for
* Enhancing your Survival server's experience
* Natural spawning of Bosses in your hardcore world
* Bosses in your Monster Arenas (or directly in [CoreArena](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/21619/))
* Challenging players in forests and caves
* Bosses with custom drops that unlock gates or give special keys
* And much more!
