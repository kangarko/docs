# Variables

A variable (placeholder) is a message in brackets `{}` (***this now also supports percents*** `%%`), which is replaced by the actual data. Example: {boss_name} is replaced with the boss name. ChatControl supports placeholders in some localization messages as well as it hooks into PlaceholderAPI so you can show your nearest Boss properties in different plugins!

**Note**: When using LuckPerms, to avoid double prefixes, we suggest you use {luckperms_prefix} from PlaceholderAPI plugin instead of {pl_prefix} from Vault.

**Warning:** We may lowercase placeholders for performance reasons. If your PlaceholderAPI contains a variable with Uppercased Letters that doesn't work, try writing it in all lower space: Such as {VotingPlugin_alltimetotal} to {votingplugin_alltimetotal}
